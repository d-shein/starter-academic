I did my PhD in the department of Mathematics at the University of British Columbia under the supervison of Dr. Alejandro Adem and cosupervised by Dr. Cihan Okay.

Previously I did my MSc in Physics under Dr.Gordon W. Semenoff 's supervision at PHAS , UBC. [Here is my MSc Thesis](https://open.library.ubc.ca/cIRcle/collections/ubctheses/24/items/1.0166503), which has some physical missinterpretations, which were fixed on our [paper](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/JHEP11(2016)083).

Before that, I did my undergrad in mathematics at the Faculty of Sciences, UNAM, doing an [undergrad thesis](132.248.9.195/ptd2013/mayo/0694342/Index.html) (written in spanish) on Simulations of boson-fermion stars in 3+1 numerical relativity, directed by Dr. Miguel Alcubierre.

In case you were curious, my favourite physicist is Albert Einstein, my favourite mathematical physicist is Sir Roger Penrose and my favourite Mathematician is Sir Michael Atiyah.

I've learned many things from the lectures and talks given at the Perimeter's institute [PIRSA](http://pirsa.org/). I recommend [this blog](https://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress/) for interesting discussions and good criticisms on current physics and mathematics as well as relevant news in these fields.
